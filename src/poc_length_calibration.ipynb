    "# POC: Length calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Context: The system has a tendency to increase README length. When I measured, I found that when updates were suggested, 100% of the time it suggested an overall increase in lines. Most PRs should result in fairly minimal README changes depending on the scope of the PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to detect how extensive the code changes are to set expectations about how extensive the README should be updated. For example:\n",
    "PR edited 10% of the files of the repo and increased the overall repo size by 5%\n",
    "Expected README change: Adjust by +/- 10% length"
