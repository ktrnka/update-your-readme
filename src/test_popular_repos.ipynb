      "-Locust is an open source performance/load testing tool for HTTP and other protocols. Its developer-friendly approach lets you define your tests in regular Python code.\n",
      "+## What is Locust?\n",
      " \n",
      "-Locust tests can be run from command line or using its web-based UI. Throughput, response times and errors can be viewed in real time and/or exported for later analysis.\n",
      "+Locust is an open-source load testing tool for web applications and APIs. It allows you to write user scenarios in Python code, making it highly flexible and capable of simulating complex user behaviors.\n",
      " \n",
      "-You can import regular Python libraries into your tests, and with Locust's pluggable architecture it is infinitely expandable. Unlike when using most other tools, your test design will never be limited by a GUI or domain-specific language.\n",
      "+## Key Features\n",
      " \n",
      "-To get started right away, head over to the [documentation](http://docs.locust.io/en/stable/installation.html).\n",
      "+- **Python-Based Test Scripts**: Write user test scenarios using plain Python code.\n",
      "+- **Distributed & Scalable**: Support for hundreds of thousands of concurrent users.\n",
      "+- **Web-Based UI**: Real-time test monitoring and control.\n",
      "+- **Extensible**: Can test any system or protocol by writing custom clients.\n",
      "+- **Highly Customizable**: Adapt to various testing scenarios using regular Python code.\n",

      " \n",
      "-#### Write user test scenarios in plain old Python\n",
      "-\n",
      "-If you want your users to loop, perform some conditional behaviour or do some calculations, you just use the regular programming constructs provided by Python. Locust runs every user inside its own greenlet (a lightweight process/coroutine). This enables you to write your tests like normal (blocking) Python code instead of having to use callbacks or some other mechanism. Because your scenarios are “just python” you can use your regular IDE, and version control your tests as regular code (as opposed to some other tools that use XML or binary formats)\n",

      " \n",
      "-Locust makes it easy to run load tests distributed over multiple machines. It is event-based (using [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/)), which makes it possible for a single process to handle many thousands concurrent users. While there may be other tools that are capable of doing more requests per second on a given hardware, the low overhead of each Locust user makes it very suitable for testing highly concurrent workloads.\n",
